# Accessibility

We are committed to complying with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). The component kit is built with the guidelines in mind. 

We outline below core accessibility concepts that are encoded, either by hand or strictly enforced code, into the codebase. Further discussions of accessibility are also included in various other guides as appropriate.
